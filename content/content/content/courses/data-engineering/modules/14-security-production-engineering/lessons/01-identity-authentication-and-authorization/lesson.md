# Identity, Authentication and Authorization

> **Memory hook:** Authentication answers who; authorization answers what they may do.

## 1. The idea in 60 seconds

**Identity, Authentication and Authorization** should be remembered as a production pattern, not a definition to memorize.

### Know these 3 things

1. ** Identity, Authentication and Authorization is useful when you need a repeatable, explainable engineering outcome—not just a one-time script.
2. ** make the behavior testable, observable and safe to rerun; document assumptions and failure handling.
3. * choose the simplest approach that meets freshness, scale, correctness, security and cost requirements.

## 2. Formula / rule to remember

> **access = identity + policy + resource**

Use the rule as a quick mental check during implementation and interviews.

## 3. Industry scenario

**Scenario:** Customer PII is processed by ingestion and analytics jobs. Access must be restricted, secrets protected and incidents auditable without blocking legitimate workloads.

**What a good engineer does:** define the input contract, choose the processing pattern, validate the result, make retries safe, and expose enough telemetry to explain failures.

## 4. Code / implementation pattern

```text
Authentication = WHO?
Authorization = WHAT may they do?
Audit = WHAT did they do?
```

### Read the code like an engineer

- **Input:** What data enters the step?
- **Transformation:** What business or technical rule changes it?
- **Output:** What is produced and at what grain?
- **Failure:** What happens if input is invalid or the job is retried?
- **Evidence:** Which test, metric or log proves it worked?


## Coding Syntax to Memorize

> **Syntax card:** Memorize the pattern first; then understand where and why to use it.

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:etl@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/bigquery.jobUser"
```

**Remember:** identify the **input → operation → output** before writing production code.

## 5. Production checklist

- [ ] Input schema / contract is explicit
- [ ] Happy path is tested
- [ ] Invalid or duplicate input has a defined behavior
- [ ] Retry / rerun behavior is safe
- [ ] Logs include useful context
- [ ] Output is validated before publication
- [ ] Ownership and runbook are documented

## 6. Common mistakes

- Explaining the tool instead of the problem
- Skipping validation evidence
- Ignoring operational ownership

## 7. 30-second memory map

**DEFINE → DESIGN → BUILD → VALIDATE → OPERATE**

If you can explain these five words without notes, you have the mental model.

## 8. Quick practice

1. Explain **Identity, Authentication and Authorization** in 60 seconds to a junior engineer.
2. Give one production use case and one case where you would avoid this approach.
3. Identify one failure mode and its mitigation.
4. Modify the code example for a realistic business field.
5. State one metric you would monitor in production.

## 9. Interview checkpoint

- Why is this pattern useful at production scale?
- What changes when data volume increases 10×?
- What happens during a retry or partial failure?
- How would you prove the output is correct?

## 10. Assignment

Build a small implementation for **Identity, Authentication and Authorization** using the supplied course lab/data where applicable. Submit:

1. source code or SQL,
2. sample input/output,
3. validation evidence,
4. one failure-handling decision,
5. a short README explaining the design.

**Goal:** finish the lesson able to **draw it, code it, explain it and debug it**.
